# 2nd-duck
Make a duck say stuff on the terminal.
This version is written in C rather
than Bash, and currently has fewer
features. I plan to add more.

## commands
`duck -e <wait> <text>` Give the duck `text` to say, `wait`ing a certain amount of time between saying each character.

`duck -h` Show help information.

`duck -p` Get the location where the duck's phrases are stored.

`duck -r <wait>` Have the duck say something random, `wait`ing a certain amount of time between saying each character.
