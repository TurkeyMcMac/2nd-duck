# 2nd-duck
Make a duck say stuff on the terminal.
This version is written in C rather
than Bash, and currently has fewer
features. I plan to add more.

## commands
`duck <wait>  <text>` Give the duck a phrase to say at a certain speed. Wait can be a number, or either `-i` or `--instant` for instant speech.
